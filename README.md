## [SARS-CoV-2 variant binding affinity prediction](../projects/binding-affinity-prediction)

**Tags:** `Python`, `Machine Learning`, `Statistics`, `Bioinformatics`

The binding between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and human receptors represents the first crucial step for cellular entry, where amino acid (AA) changes in the variants could affect their binding affinity significantly. This project brief describes how a convolutional neural network model is built to predict the binding affinity change upon AA changes, and how this model can be applied to both human and animal cases.

## [Polymer properties prediction](../projects/polymer-property-prediction.md)

**Tags:** `Python`, `Machine Learning`, `Cheminformatics`

The properties of polymers are strongly but not exclusively by the monomers that construct them. This project combines cheminformatics and machine learning to build a simple decision tree model to estimate the glass transition temperature (Tg) and intrinsic viscosity (IV) of some homopolymers.

## [Stock price analysis](../projects/stock-price-analysis)

**Tags:** `Python`, `Statistics`, `SQL`

Predicting the stock price fluctuation behavior relies on the understanding of its historical patterns. This project covers the construction of a local database, the fundamental statistical analyses of stock prices, and the design of a Markov chain model.
