## [SARS-CoV-2 variant binding affinity prediction](../projects/binding-affinity-prediction)

**Tags:** `Python`, `Machine Learning`, `Bioinformatics`, `Convolutional Neural Network`

The binding between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and human receptors represents the first crucial step for cellular entry, where amino acid (AA) changes in the variants could affect their binding affinity significantly. This project brief describes how a convolutional neural network model is built to predict the binding affinity change upon AA changes, and how this model can be applied to study the animals.

## [Stock price analysis](../projects/stock-price-analysis)

**Tags:** `Python`, `Statistics`, `SQL`

Predicting the stock price fluctuation behavior relies on the understanding of its historical patterns. This project covers the construction of a local database, the fundamental statistical analyses of stock prices, and the design of a Markov chain model.
